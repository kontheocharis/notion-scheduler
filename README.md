# `notion-scheduler`

This tool allows the creation of---drumroll---recurring tasks in Notion!

This is done by defining a Notion database (which I will call the Scheduled database) that contains rules for recurring tasks. This tool reads these definitions and creates each occurrence of those tasks in your actual tasks database (which I will call the Tasks database).

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible if this tool causes any data loss in your Notion database. Always back up your data!

**Documentation coming soon.**
